## Tasks to your mind 👍


**Note** Try to solve by your own and then check the solution or compare with your own. 💯


### 1. Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters, what if you can not use additional data structures?

### 2. Given an array of numbers (a list in groovy), determine whether the sum of all of the numbers is odd or even. Give your answer in string format as 'odd' or 'even'. If the input array is empty consider it as: [0] (array with a zero).

    Examples:
    oddorEven([0]) returns "even"
    oddorEven([2,5,24]) returns "odd"
    oddOrEven([0, -1, -5]) returns "even"

### 3. Write a function that sums all numbers in an array that can have nested sub-arrays. Do not use loops.

    Example:
    sumOfNestedArray([1,[11,42,[8, 1], 4, [22,21]]]) returns 110
